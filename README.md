### Custom framework...
... similar to joomla (some codebase is even picked from it. And all names are compatible. This is because project started as joomla extension)

### Embarrasing code...
...with a lot of dirty/quick fixes. But it worked and more than 20K people used app on daily base

## Note that...
... this is not original code but code changed in order to work with new php and to work with database backup I had. Probably not the latest code nor database structure :(
